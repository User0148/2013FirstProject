# My First Full-Stack Project

This is my first full-stack project, completed in 2023. It was built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js/Express** for the back-end.

This project allows users to register a club in a city and search for clubs by city. It's a simple application to manage clubs and find them easily based on the city they are located in.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: React
- **Back-end**: Node.js/Express
- **API Handling**: React Query, Axios

## Features

- **Register a Club**: Users can add a club to a specific city.
- **Search for Clubs by City**: Users can search for clubs by entering a city name.
- Full-stack architecture with React handling the UI and Node.js/Express serving the API.
- Utilized **React Query** for data fetching and state management.
- Integrated **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the back-end.
